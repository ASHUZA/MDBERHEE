                <h2>Genesis 2</h2><span id="en-AMP-32" class="sup">1</span>THUS THE heavens and the earth were finished, and all the
                host of them.
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-33" class="sup">2</span>And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done; and He
                rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-33A"
                    title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup>
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-34" class="sup">3</span>And God blessed (spoke good of) the seventh day, set it apart as His
                own,
                and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all His work which He had created and done.<sup>(<a
                    href="#cen-AMP-34B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup>
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-35" class="sup">4</span>This is the history of the heavens and of the earth when they were
                created. In the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens--
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-36" class="sup">5</span>When no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the
                field
                had yet sprung up, for the Lord God had not [yet] caused it to rain upon the earth and there was no man to till the
                ground,
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-37" class="sup">6</span>But there went up a mist (fog, vapor) from the land and watered the
                whole
                surface of the ground--
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-38" class="sup">7</span>Then the Lord God formed man from the <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-38a"
                    title=" a">a</a>]</sup>dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath or spirit of life, and
                man
                became a living being.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-38C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup>
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-39" class="sup">8</span>And the Lord God planted a garden toward the east, in Eden [delight];
                and
                there He put the man whom He had formed (framed, constituted).
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-40" class="sup">9</span>And out of the ground the Lord God made to grow every tree that is
                pleasant to the sight or to be desired--good (suitable, pleasant) for food; the tree of life also in the center of
                the
                garden, and the tree of the knowledge of [the difference between] good and evil and blessing and calamity.<sup>(<a
                    href="#cen-AMP-40D" title="See cross-reference D">D</a>)</sup>
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-41" class="sup">10</span>Now a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it
                divided and became four [river] heads.
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-42" class="sup">11</span>The first is named Pishon; it is the one flowing around the whole
                land
                of Havilah, where there is gold.
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-43" class="sup">12</span>The gold of that land is of high quality; bdellium (pearl?) and onyx
                stone are there.
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-44" class="sup">13</span>The second river is named Gihon; it is the one flowing around the
                whole
                land of Cush.
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-45" class="sup">14</span>The third river is named Hiddekel [the Tigris]; it is the one
                flowing
                east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-46" class="sup">15</span>And the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to
                tend
                and guard and keep it.
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-47" class="sup">16</span>And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, You may freely eat of
                every
                tree of the garden;
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-48" class="sup">17</span>But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and blessing and
                calamity you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-49" class="sup">18</span>Now the Lord God said, It is not good (sufficient, satisfactory)
                that
                the man should be alone; I will make him a helper meet (suitable, adapted, complementary) for him.
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-50" class="sup">19</span>And out of the ground the Lord God formed every [wild] beast and
                living
                creature of the field and every bird of the air and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them; and
                whatever
                Adam called every living creature, that was its name.
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-51" class="sup">20</span>And Adam gave names to all the livestock and to the birds of the air
                and
                to every [wild] beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a helper meet (suitable, adapted,
                complementary)
                for him.
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-52" class="sup">21</span>And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam; and while he
                slept, He took one of his ribs or a part of his side and closed up the [place with] flesh.
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-53" class="sup">22</span>And the rib or part of his side which the Lord God had taken from
                the
                man He built up and made into a woman, and He brought her to the man.
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-54" class="sup">23</span>Then Adam said, This [creature] is now bone of my bones and flesh of
                my
                flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of a man.
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-55" class="sup">24</span>Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall
                become
                united and cleave to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-55E"
                    title="See cross-reference E">E</a>)</sup>
                <p /> <span id="en-AMP-56" class="sup">25</span>And the man and his wife were both naked and were not embarrassed or
                ashamed in each other's presence.
